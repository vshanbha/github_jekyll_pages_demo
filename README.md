# GitHub Jekyll Pages Demo

## Introduction
This repository is meant to help create a quick start / Hello world version of a website using Jekyll and Markdown as a way of creating a website from plain text.

This page covers developer instructions to work with this repository. 

## Usage Pre-Requisites
This repository is meant as a template repository for a blog site and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to transform markdown files into HTML. It has necessary setup to be deployed on to GitHub pages.

If you simply want to publish files using the default theme and markdown files and are happy to let Github pages do the publishing then the is not much to do just learn a little bit about Jekyll site structure and start creating posts inside the `_posts` directory. There is a getting started post already included there. You can start by editing that post.

If you want to edit and preview files on local machine then some set up is needed.
